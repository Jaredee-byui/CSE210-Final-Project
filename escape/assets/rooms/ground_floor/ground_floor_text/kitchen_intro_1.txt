	Yep, this is a kitchen. Stove and all. There's some old
glass milk bottles sitting on the countertop. You could probably resell those
at a flea market for a quick buck. An old kitchen KNIFE sits on one of the
counters. A door leading to the PANTRY sits in the corner. Behind you is the
door to the DINING ROOM.
